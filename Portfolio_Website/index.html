                            Computer programming is an art, because it applies accumulated knowledge to the world,
                            <br> because it requires skill and ingenuity, and especially because it produces objects of beauty.

                            <br> will enjoy what he does and will do it better.

                <h1>About</h1>
                <p>I am an aspiring software developer and native of Denver, Colorado with an infatuation with technology.
                     I absolutely love my home state and it’s beautiful scenery. When I’m not working, studying or spending time with my young cat, 
                     I enjoy attending live music concerts, camping,  travelling and relaxing with a good book or an occasional video-game.<br>
                    <br> I come from a background in construction, specifically glazing and architectural metal fabrication…  
                    My newfound interest in computer programming came from seeing firsthand the implementation of automation at my current job within our fabrication shop.
                     This incredible machine, when programmed to do so, was able to do everything my coworkers and myself were trained to do with immaculate precision and outstanding speed.
                      It was then when I realized the importance of this kind of technology in the industry because it offered efficiency and safety. 
                      So, from then on, I elected to evolve with the automation revolution rather than reject it like many of my peers.<br>
                      <br><q>Whether you want to uncover the secrets of the universe, or you just want to pursue a career in the 21st century, basic computer programming is an essential skill to learn</q>
                      <br>-Stephen Hawking<br>
                    <br> I am currently a student of <a href="https://www.learncodinganywhere.com" target="_blank">The Tech Academy</a>'s Software Developer Boot Camp. Upon completion of the boot camp, 
                    I will be a full-stack developer with experience and training in the folowing programming languages: HTML, CSS, Javascript, SQL, C# and more.
